<!-- # Brick Breaker Game

Brick Breaker (The game) is a Breakout clonewhich the player must smash a wall of bricks by deflecting a bouncing ball with a paddle. The paddle may move horizontally and is controlled with the side arrow keys.

This code appears to be a Python program that implements a simple game using the Pygame library. The game is called "Brickstroy" and the goal is to destroy all the bricks in the game area using a ball that bounces around the screen. The player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen that can be moved left or right to hit the ball and keep it in play.

The code defines several classes, including a Ball class that controls the behavior of the ball, a Block class that creates and draws the bricks, and a User_Paddle class that controls the behavior of the player's paddle. The program also defines several functions to handle user input and draw the game elements on the screen.

The main game loop is contained within a while loop that runs until the player either destroys all the bricks or the ball falls off the bottom of the screen. The loop updates the positions of the ball and paddle, checks for collisions between the ball, paddle, and bricks, and updates the score and game state accordingly.

Overall, this code appears to be a good example of how to use Pygame to create a simple game with basic physics and collision detection.
